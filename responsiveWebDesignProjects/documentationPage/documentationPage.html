          detail, and adds some new things as well.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
      <header>Lists</header>
      <article>
        <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together
          other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a
          list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists
          might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have
          the same type.</p>
          <code>
                 >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] <br>
                 >>> squares <br>
                 [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
          </code>
        <p>Like strings (and all other built-in sequence type), lists can be
          indexed and sliced:</p>
          <code>
                  >>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item <br>
                  1 <br>
                  >>> squares[-1] <br>
                  25 <br>
                  >>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list <br>
                  [9, 16, 25]
          </code>
        <p>All slice operations return a new list containing the requested
          elements. This means that the following slice returns a new (shallow)
          copy of the list:</p>
          <code>
            >>> squares[:] <br>
            [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
          </code>
        <p>Lists also support operations like concatenation:</p>
          <code>
            >>> squares + [36, 49, 64, 81, 100] <br>
            [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
          </code>
        <p>Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it
          is possible to change their content:</p>
          <code>
            >>> cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125]  # something's wrong here <br>
            >>> 4 ** 3  # the cube of 4 is 64, not 65! <br>
            64 <br>
            >>> cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value <br>
            >>> cubes <br>
            [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
          </code>
        <p>It is possible to nest lists (create lists containing other lists),
          for example:</p>
          <code>
            >>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c'] <br>
            >>> n = [1, 2, 3] <br>
            >>> x = [a, n] <br>
            >>> x <br>
            [['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]] <br>
            >>> x[0] <br>
            ['a', 'b', 'c'] <br>
            >>> x[0][1] <br>
            'b'
          </code>

        <li><h4>Using Lists as Stacks</h4>
          <p>The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where
             the last element added is the first element retrieved
             (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack,
             use append(). To retrieve an item from the top of the stack,
             use pop() without an explicit index. For example:</p>
             <code>
               >>> stack = [3, 4, 5] <br>
               >>> stack.append(6) <br>
               >>> stack.append(7) <br>
               >>> stack <br>
               [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] <br>
               >>> stack.pop() <br>
               7 <br>
               >>> stack <br>
               [3, 4, 5, 6] <br>
               >>> stack.pop() <br>
               6 <br>
               >>> stack.pop() <br>
               5 <br>
               >>> stack <br>
               [3, 4]
             </code>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Using Lists as Queues</h4>
          <p>It is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first
            element added is the first element retrieved
            (“first-in, first-out”); however, lists are not efficient for this
            purpose. While appends and pops from the end of list are fast,
            doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow
            (because all of the other elements have to be shifted by one).</p>
          <p>To implement a queue, use collections.deque which was designed to
             have fast appends and pops from both ends. For example:</p>
            <code>
              >>> from collections import deque <br>
              >>> queue = deque(["Eric", "John", "Michael"]) <br>
              >>> queue.append("Terry")           # Terry arrives <br>
              >>> queue.append("Graham")          # Graham arrives <br>
              >>> queue.popleft()                 # The first to arrive now leaves <br>
              'Eric' <br>
              >>> queue.popleft()                 # The second to arrive now leaves <br>
              'John' <br>
              >>> queue                           # Remaining queue in order of arrival <br>
              deque(['Michael', 'Terry', 'Graham'])
            </code>
        </li>

        <li><h4>List Comprehensions</h4>
          <p>List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common
             applications are to make new lists where each element is the result
              of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or
              iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy
              a certain condition.</p>
          <p>For example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:</p>
            <code>
              >>> squares = [] <br>
              >>> for x in range(10): <br>
              ...     squares.append(x**2) <br>
              ... <br>
              >>> squares <br>
              [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
            </code>
          <p>Note that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named x that still
             exists after the loop completes. We can calculate the list of squares
              without any side effects using:</p>
            <code>
              squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))
            </code>
          <p>or, equivalently:</p>
            <code>
              squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
            </code>
          <p>which is more concise and readable.</p>
          <p>A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression
             followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The
              result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression
               in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it. For
               example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they
               are not equal:</p>
            <code>
              >>> [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y] <br>
              [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]
            </code>
          <p>and it’s equivalent to:</p>
            <code>
              >>> combs = [] <br>
              >>> for x in [1,2,3]: <br>
              ...     for y in [3,1,4]: <br>
              ...         if x != y: <br>
              ...             combs.append((x, y)) <br>
              ... <br>
              >>> combs <br>
              [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]
            </code>
          <p>List comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested
            functions:</p>
            <code>
              >>> from math import pi <br>
              >>> [str(round(pi, i)) for i in range(1, 6)] <br>
              ['3.1', '3.14', '3.142', '3.1416', '3.14159']
            </code>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Nested List Comprehensions</h4>
          <p>The initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary
            expression, including another list comprehension.</p>
          <p>Consider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list
            of 3 lists of length 4:</p>
            <code>
              >>> matrix = [ <br>
              ...     [1, 2, 3, 4], <br>
              ...     [5, 6, 7, 8], <br>
              ...     [9, 10, 11, 12], <br>
              ... ]
            </code>
          <p>The following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns:</p>
            <code>
              >>> [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)] <br>
              [[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]
            </code>
          <p>As we saw in the previous section, the nested listcomp is evaluated
            in the context of the for that follows it, so this example is
            equivalent to:</p>
            <code>
              >>> transposed = [] <br>
              >>> for i in range(4): <br>
              ...     transposed.append([row[i] for row in matrix]) <br>
              ... <br>
              >>> transposed <br>
              [[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]
            </code>
          <p>which, in turn, is the same as:</p>
            <code>
              >>> transposed = [] <br>
              >>> for i in range(4): <br>
              ...     # the following 3 lines implement the nested listcomp <br>
              ...     transposed_row = [] <br>
              ...     for row in matrix: <br>
              ...         transposed_row.append(row[i]) <br>
              ...     transposed.append(transposed_row) <br>
              ... <br>
              >>> transposed <br>
              [[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]
            </code>
          <p>In the real world, you should prefer built-in functions to complex
            flow statements. The zip() function would do a great job for this use
            case:</p>
            <code>
              >>> list(zip(*matrix)) <br>
              [(1, 5, 9), (2, 6, 10), (3, 7, 11), (4, 8, 12)]
            </code>
        </li>

        <li><h4>The del statement</h4>
          <p>There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead
            of its value: the del statement. This differs from the pop() method
            which returns a value. The del statement can also be used to remove
            slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by
            assignment of an empty list to the slice). For example:</p>
            <code>
              >>> a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5] <br>
              >>> del a[0] <br>
              >>> a <br>
              [1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5] <br>
              >>> del a[2:4] <br>
              >>> a <br>
              [1, 66.25, 1234.5] <br>
              >>> del a[:] <br>
              >>> a <br>
              []
            </code>
          <p>del can also be used to delete entire variables:</p>
            <code>
              >>> del a
            </code>
          <p>Referencing the name a hereafter is an error (at least until another
            value is assigned to it). We’ll find other uses for del later.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Tuples_and_Sequences">
      <header>Tuples and Sequences</header>
      <article>
        <p>We saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as
           indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of sequence
           data types (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range). Since Python is
           an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is
           also another standard sequence data type: the tuple.</p>
        <p>A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas,
          for instance:</p>
          <code>
            >>> t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!' <br>
            >>> t[0] <br>
            12345 <br>
            >>> t <br>
            (12345, 54321, 'hello!') <br>
            >>> # Tuples may be nested: <br>
            ... u = t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) <br>
            >>> u <br>
            ((12345, 54321, 'hello!'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) <br>
            >>> # Tuples are immutable: <br>
            ... t[0] = 88888 <br>
            Traceback (most recent call last): <br>
              File "&#60;stdin&#62;", line 1, in &#60;module&#62; <br>
            TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment <br>
            >>> # but they can contain mutable objects: <br>
            ... v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]) <br>
            >>> v <br>
            ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])
          </code>
        <p>As you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so
          that nested tuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with or
          without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are
          necessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression). It is
          not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, however it
          is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as
          lists.</p>
        <p>Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in
          different situations and for different purposes. Tuples are immutable,
           and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are
           accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or
           even by attribute in the case of namedtuples). Lists are mutable, and
           their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating
           over the list.</p>
          <p>A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1
            items: the syntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these. Empty
            tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with
            one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not
            sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but
            effective. For example:</p>
            <code>
              >>> empty = () <br>
              >>> singleton = 'hello',    # < -- note trailing comma <br>
              >>> len(empty) <br>
              0 <br>
              >>> len(singleton) <br>
              1 <br>
              >>> singleton <br>
              ('hello',)
            </code>
          <p>The statement t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!' is an example of tuple
             packing: the values 12345, 54321 and 'hello!' are packed together in
             a tuple. The reverse operation is also possible:</p>
             <code>
               >>> x, y, z = t
             </code>
          <p>This is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works
            for any sequence on the right-hand side. Sequence unpacking requires
            that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign
            as there are elements in the sequence. Note that multiple assignment
            is really just a combination of tuple packing and sequence
            unpacking.</p>

        <p>Python also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered
          collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership
          testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support
          mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and
          symmetric difference.</p>
        <p>Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets.
          Note: to create an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter
          creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the
          next section.</p>
        <p>Here is a brief demonstration:</p>
          <code>
            >>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'} <br>
            >>> print(basket)                      # show that duplicates have been removed <br>
            {'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'} <br>
            >>> 'orange' in basket                 # fast membership testing <br>
            True <br>
            >>> 'crabgrass' in basket <br>
            False <br>
            <br>
            >>> # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words <br>
            ... <br>
            >>> a = set('abracadabra') <br>
            >>> b = set('alacazam') <br>
            >>> a                                  # unique letters in a <br>
            {'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'} <br>
            >>> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b <br>
            {'r', 'd', 'b'} <br>
            >>> a | b                              # letters in a or b or both <br>
            {'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'} <br>
            >>> a & b                              # letters in both a and b <br>
            {'a', 'c'} <br>
            >>> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both <br>
            {'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
          </code>
        <p>Similarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also
          supported:</p>
          <code>
            >>> a = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'} <br>
            >>> a <br>
            {'r', 'd'}
          </code>

      <article>
        <p>Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary
          (see Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other
          languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike
          sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are
          indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers
          can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only
          strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object
          either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t
          use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index
          assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and
          extend().</p>
        <p>It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs,
          with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary).
          A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a
          comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial
          key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries
          are written on output.</p>
        <p>The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key
          and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a
          key:value pair with del. If you store using a key that is already in
          use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an
          error to extract a value using a non-existent key.</p>
        <p>Performing list(d) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used
          in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use
          sorted(d) instead). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary,
          use the in keyword.</p>
        <p>Here is a small example using a dictionary:</p>
          <code>
            >>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139} <br>
            >>> tel['guido'] = 4127 <br>
            >>> tel <br>
            {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127} <br>
            >>> tel['jack'] <br>
            4098 <br>
            >>> del tel['sape'] <br>
            >>> tel['irv'] = 4127 <br>
            >>> tel <br>
            {'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127, 'irv': 4127} <br>
            >>> list(tel) <br>
            ['jack', 'guido', 'irv'] <br>
            >>> sorted(tel) <br>
            ['guido', 'irv', 'jack'] <br>
            >>> 'guido' in tel <br>
            True <br>
            >>> 'jack' not in tel <br>
            False
          </code>
        <p>The dict() constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of
          key-value pairs:</p>
          <code>
            >>> dict([('sape', 4139), ('guido', 4127), ('jack', 4098)]) <br>
            {'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098}
          </code>
        <p>In addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries
          from arbitrary key and value expressions:</p>
          <code>
            >>> {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)} <br>
            {2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36}
          </code>
        <p>When the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify
          pairs using keyword arguments:</p>
          <code>
            >>> dict(sape=4139, guido=4127, jack=4098) <br>
            {'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098}
          </code>
